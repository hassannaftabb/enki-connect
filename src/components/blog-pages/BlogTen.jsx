</div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>Meta, previously known as Facebook, has provided an amazing platform for businesses. Small-scale businesses can start on platforms like Instagram and Facebook for free. The combination of these platforms with good advertisement services was the reason behind several successful startups across the globe. However, several Facebook and Instagram business account users are sharing their Meta hacking experiences they got hacked.

                <div className='blogOneText'>Meta, previously known as Facebook, has provided an amazing platform for businesses. Small-scale businesses can start on platforms like Instagram and Facebook for free. The combination of these platforms with good advertisement services was the reason behind several successful startups across the globe. However, several Facebook and Instagram business account users are sharing their Meta hacking experiences they got hacked.
</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'> Due to this, several business owners struggle to get their accounts back from Meta. At the same time, many others are worried about their account's privacy. There is a lot of fuss about it, and here we will clarify everything for you.

</div>

                <div className='blogOneTitle'>What is all the Meta hacking confusion about?

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>Facebook and Instagram business accounts were an amazing solution for individuals looking to take their business to digital heights. Several individuals were using these platforms to run their business accounts from all over the world. Unsurprisingly, most businesses were thriving only because of these platforms, as their years of hard work got them thousands of likes and followers.

</div>
                <div className='blogOneTitle'>The reason issue for hacking.

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>A few weeks back, Facebook users and Instagram users started getting an Email one by one, which were usually about them violating the community guidelines on those platforms. Some emails even included the reason for that violation because child exploitation images were posted on those accounts.

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>Due to these violations, the accounts of all those users were banned while they did not even post something that violated community standards. The reason behind such posts was that those business accounts were being hacked, and those hackers were behind the ban of their accounts.

</div>

                <div className='blogOneTitle'>Lack of communication makes things worse.

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>Like everyone else, whoever got that email and lost access to their account was trying to contact Facebook and Instagram and even the parent company Meta. However, none of those platforms have been providing any sort of communication. Most users are getting automated responses to their messages.

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>Even after a few months, there has been no real response from the company about the revival of those accounts.
<br />Some of the responses people got were informing those users of the reason for the ban was hacking or phishing attacks. 
<br />Those responses also included that the platform cannot help revive that account. So, those accounts stay banned no matter how paramount those accounts were for the users.
<br />According to several users going through the same problem, Meta is doing nothing to protect users on their platforms even when the defect lies on their end. Instead, they are turning everything on the users. 
                
                <div className='blogOneText'>So, it turns out to be a drastic situation for users who have been working hard to grow their business for years. Now their year of hard work is no use because their accounts with thousands of followers and like to have just been banned/deactivated by the platform itself.

                <div className='blogOneTitle'>What are the major downfalls of this event?

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>There are many major downfalls because of this event. While most of them are affecting the business owners, some may also affect Meta and its child companies considering the business platform it brings. Below are some of the biggest downfalls of this event.

</div>
                <div className='blogOneTitle'>Business owners are losing all their gains.

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>The first and the biggest downfall is that business owners lose all their gains. For such businesses where Facebook and Instagram were bringing most of their clients, that rate of getting clients may get too low. Similarly, with their accounts getting banned, those thousands of followers and likes will take a long time for them to regain.

</div>
 
                <div className='blogOneTitle'>Lack of trust and credibility

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>Facebook, Instagram, and Meta may lose their trust and credibility as a platform. The biggest issue here is the mass communication from Meta's end. After this incident, most users will not consider these platforms safe because of Instagram and Facebook hacking for business. No support from meta and only providing automated responses also creates a lack of credibility.

 </div>
                <div className='blogOneTitle'>Facebook and Instagram platforms are emerging as not safe at all

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>People usually trust tech giants like these because of their reliability and safety. If these platforms do not rectify this loophole in their backend, they may start to emerge as not safe. It might be when some other reliable platform may take its place in the market from another tech giant.

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>It will also create many problems for business owners who have been using Facebook and Instagram as their primary business platforms for years before Meta hacking.


</div>

                <div className='blogOneTitle'>Is there any solution to Meta hacking now?

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>Taking the right steps can bring the best solution to things like Meta hacking or Instagram and Facebook business hacking. Mostly, this solution depends on support from Meta and its solutions. Below are some of the solutions for Instagram and Facebook hacking for business.

</div>

                <div className='blogOneTitle'>The technical teams must solve the issue at their end

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>The first solution is that the technical teams rectify the issue as soon as possible. Meta is a huge tech giant, and it must rectify the technical issue in the backend of those platforms that lead to this Instagram and Facebook hacking for business issue.

</div>
                <div className='blogOneTitle'>There must be better communication from the platform
</div>

                <div className='blogOneText'>There must be Support from Meta for those business owners. With the right communication, this issue could have been solved quickly. However, there is no human support from meta; that is the reason behind all the issues emerging after Instagram and Facebook hacking for business.

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>So, there must be human support from meta that solves queries of the business accounts running on its platforms instead of AI sending automatic responses. When there is human support, any business account holder can prove that they will effortlessly rectify the issue within a minute. Lastly, These platforms must review the whole situation and solve the problem instead of telling people they cannot do but ban their accounts by flagging them as “breaking policy”.
</div>
                <div className='blogOneTitle'>Enki Connect brings the best communication solution.

</div>

                <div className='blogOneText'>Enki Connect brings an innovative application for learning, sharing, and earning all on one platform. Business owners can communicate with similar individuals to solve problems or learn skills with such platforms. Additionally, huge tech giants like Meta can use such platforms to ensure better communication with individuals instead of Ai conducting every communication.
</div>
                <div className='blogOneTitle'>Final Remarks:


</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>Almost every other business relies on these tech giants like Meta. While an individual user using Facebook or Instagram as a socializing platform may not be hugely affected by such issues, businesses, especially startups, are adversely affected by Meta hacking. 

</div>
                <div className='blogOneText'>Opening a new account after losing access to the older one is not the solution for individuals earning based on these accounts. However, instead of depending solely on these tech giants, people must start taking steps in the right direction.
