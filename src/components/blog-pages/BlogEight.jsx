                        An advisor is an expert with knowledge and experience that they use to advise their clients.
                        Traditionally, companies hire advisors for efficient decision-making.
                        However, now things are changing, and professionals are starting to work as freelancers.
                        It benefits both sides where companies get better advice and professionals get better opportunities.

            <div className='blogOneText'>
                If you have advisor skills and want to serve the freelance market, there is not much you need to do.
                Below are a few simple things you will need to do to become a freelance advisor in 2022.
            </div>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <div className="blogOneTitle">Select your niche</div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        The chances are that if you have been working with a company, then you were limited to only a few things.
                        You were not dealing with a broader perspective.
                        When you go for freelance services, you get the chance to increase your perspective and get more exposure.
                    </div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        So, it would help if you started with a niche.
                        That could be any niche, and under that niche, you can work with as many fields as possible.
                        However, staying within that niche during your learning years is the most important.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div className="blogOneTitle">Create your profile</div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        Your profile for the freelance world will work as your CV for the physical jobs.
                        It does not matter what platform you work on.
                        The first impressions from your profile will be very important.
                        Try to put as much work as possible into making your profile.
                        Making your website is a great idea where you can have all of the following things:
                        <ul className="list-items">
                            <li>Portfolio</li>
                            <li>Blog</li>
                            <li>Case studies</li>
                            <li>Client testimonials</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        Having such stuff will be proof of your expertise and experience. So, you should present it as well as possible.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div className="blogOneTitle">Choose your prices</div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        It is the part where you will need to do a little research.
                        Doing market research is important because you will not stay very efficient without it.
                        You will either charge too low or too high, and in both of these cases, you will not be at a benefit.
                    </div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        So, when you are done making your profile, go to different freelance marketplaces and look for people offering similar services.
                        There you will find how much everyone is charging.
                        Simply take an average idea of that amount, and you can keep that as your price.
                    </div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        Making different packages with different services and prices will also be attractive for buyers.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div className="blogOneTitle">Learn how will you manage your freelance work</div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        Most freelancers learn this the hard way. They usually start freelancing without planning anything.
                        Soon they find out that freelance is not made for them. A major reason is the mismanagement of time.
                        Even though it is not going to be your traditional office 9-5 job, you need to be sure that you are planning things.
                    </div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        Knowing your working hours will allow you to be more flexible with the work.
                        Similarly, you will have more personal time to relax and spend with your family.

                    <div className="blogOneTitle">Learn to decline</div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        Nobody likes saying no to money.
                        When we are in the freelance advisor market, we get a lot of offers that are not just fair.
                        Instead of falling for the money, you must learn to say no.
                        Declining can also be your way to take the client towards negotiating.
                    </div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        So, instead of taking every offer, make sure that you know your worth as well as your field of work.
                        Now you will be able to focus better on the jobs that reward you well.

                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        One major difference between working at a contract-based job and working as a freelancer in the advisor field is your income.
                        In a contract-based job, you know how much you will constantly earn.
                        However, in the freelance field, there could be rises and falls.
                    </div>
                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        If you are going to rely on freelance earning by being an advisor, you must bring some diversity to your income.
                        It will save you from going broke if you do not earn good money by bringing a freelance advisor.
                        The good part is that you can go for any other skill that lets you manage things together efficiently.

                    <div className='blogOneText'>
                        If you want to get ahead in the competition, working hard is not the only thing you need to focus on.
